# Introduction
Hi there, welcome to c-snake-raylib!

This repository is for a snake game written in C using raylib!

More information will be added here in the future

# Acknowledgements
This project uses raylib, a library created to help with game programming! \
Here are some links with more information about raylib: \
website: https://www.raylib.com \
github: https://github.com/raysan5/raylib

The CMake template I have used is (mostly) from a github gist, \
which is linked in this video by the creator: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_i4wRjcp8eU

The sublime text project file setup (along with the compile errors highlighting) is based \
on a similar setup done by [Karl Zylinski](https://www.youtube.com/@karl_zylinski) for an Odin project in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF2MgVqfBV8
